Man, just watched The Parenting and I gotta tell ya, it's got all the feels. Like, wow, didn't see it comin'. You know that movie where you're like, Is this a comedy or drama? and it hits ya with both? Yeah, that's the one. I'm tellin' you, you should totally download the movie when you get a chance. Or like, just watch the movie if you’re not into downloading stuff these days. Streaming’s where it's at, right?

> So there's this one part where the dad's just losing his mind over the kid's antics, and I'm sitting there thinking, Damn, I've been there! You know when you’re just trying to do your job, and life throws this curveball at ya? Yep, story of my life.

Anyway, I gotta say, some parts had me laughing way harder than I thought I would, and then BOOM, next thing I'm gettin' all teary-eyed. I swear, sometimes I feel like these movies know exactly how to sucker-punch me right in the emotions, know what I mean?

But seriously, it's one of those “this is life” kind of deals. Makes you think about what you’re doin’ with your own life. Or maybe I’m just overtired. Could be both. Haha, you ever have nights like that? Speaking of which, remind me to grab some more coffee next time we hang out. Need a serious caffeine boost after all that emotional rollercoaster.

// Why did I put this here again? Magic code I forget...

Oh, and before I forget, if you're free this weekend, hit me up. We gotta catch up over a beer or three. I need that debrief session.
